# PIZZA-SALES-ANALYSIS

# Pizza Sales Dashboard

This repository contains the MySQL queries and Power BI dashboard for analyzing and visualizing pizza sales data. The project demonstrates how to use SQL for data exploration and Power BI for creating an interactive and insightful dashboard.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze pizza sales data to uncover trends, insights, and key performance indicators (KPIs). Using MySQL, the raw dataset was queried and processed to prepare it for visualization. The insights were then visualized using Power BI to create an interactive dashboard that helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

### Key Features of the Dashboard
- **Sales Trends:** Track daily, weekly, and monthly sales.
- **Product Performance:** Identify the best-performing pizza types and toppings.
- **Customer Insights:** Analyze purchasing behavior and patterns.
- **Revenue Breakdown:** Visualize revenue distribution across categories and time periods.

## Tools and Technologies
- **MySQL:** For querying and preprocessing the pizza sales dataset.
- **Power BI:** For creating the interactive dashboard.
- **Dataset:** Pizza sales data (details available in the uploaded file).
